	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm based on how the execution time grows with the size of the input. It is expressed using Big O notation, such as O(1), O(n), or O(n²), where n is the input size. An algorithm is considered efficient if it solves a problem with minimal time increase as input grows. For example, O(n) means the time grows linearly with the input size, making it more efficient than O(n²) for large inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures how much memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size and is also expressed using Big O notation, such as O(1) or O(n). An algorithm is efficient in terms of space if it uses the least possible memory while solving the problem correctly. For instance, O(n) space complexity indicates that memory usage grows linearly with input size, while O(1) means the memory remains constant regardless of input, making it more space-efficient.</p>
